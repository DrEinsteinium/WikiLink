Thanks for visiting my GitHub page!

This is the source code for a Minecraft Forge modification that allows the user to click on items while in game, either in the inventory interface or by pointing their cursor towards an entity or block in the world, and search on the internet for information on that object. This mod was made to help players who have hundreds of mods installed to easily find information on specific items and to help them find a better understanding of the mechanics of the game. 

Due to the refactoring of Minecraft in 1.7, I discontinued the project, but I am leaving the source code up in case anyone would like to continue it in the future. If you're interested, please contact my through Twitter.
